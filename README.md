# duckdb-python

A simple "Hello World" to get started with duckdb for python. 

# Quick Start

The following will seed a persistent duckdb database called `duckdb_python/db/master.duckdb` with Los Angeles 311 service request data for 2023 using a CSV file downloaded from [data.lacity.org](https://data.lacity.org/City-Infrastructure-Service-Requests/MyLA311-Service-Request-Data-2023/4a4x-mna2) and demonstrates how to output the result of the SQL query `SELECT * FROM requests limit 1` to the console. 

Perform the following steps from the terminal  
* git clone git@github.com:edwinjue/duckdb-python.git
* cd duckdb-python
* python -m virtualenv venv
* source ./venv/bin/activate
* pip install -r requirements.txt
* mkdir -p duckdb_python/data/csv
* mkdir -p duckdb_python/data/parquet
* mkdir -p duckdb_python/db
* curl -o ./duckdb_python/data/csv/requests.csv -O https://data.lacity.org/api/views/4a4x-mna2/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD
* python [main.py](https://github.com/edwinjue/duckdb-python/blob/main/main.py)
